# Tital
Tital is an open-source jailbreak for macOS Leopard to macOS 10.12 (patched in 10.12.1)
I created this jailbreak using the physmem local privilege escalator for Mac OS X Leopard to macOS Sierra 10.12 (hence why it is patched in 10.12.1)

# Support
Tital supports macOS Leopard (In theory) to macOS Sierra 10.12 (patched in 10.12.1)
It is compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
I have NOT tested Tital on a 32-bit machine, only on my 64-bit MacBook Pro.
# Capabilities
Tital allows you to write anything to the rootfs easily by modifying the "rootfs" folder and creating a file system structure to add files.
# Power
Tital is VERY POWERFUL. I am NOT responsible for ANYTHING done with the Tital software.
